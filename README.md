## Technologies

- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Project Takeaways

- Writing class based components
- Managing state
- Conditionally rendering components
- Generating components from mapping over an array
- Using Tailwind to write css

## Other Notes

I'm really enjoying writing React and Tailwind was nice once I got used to writing entirely in
utility classes. I still need to find a way to decide at what point to break out a section into its
own component.
